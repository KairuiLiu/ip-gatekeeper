# Privacy Policy for IP Gatekeeper

## Last Updated: 04/02/2025

## Introduction

IP Gatekeeper ("we", "our", or "extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and what choices you have concerning your data.

## Information We Collect

### IP Address and Geolocation Data

The extension temporarily accesses your IP address and geolocation information (country code) to perform IP safety checks. This is the core functionality of our extension.

### Configuration Settings

We store your protection rules and preferences locally in your browser using Chrome's storage API.

## How We Use Information

Your IP address and country code are used solely to:
- Verify whether your current location is safe for accessing your configured websites
- Display real-time status information in the extension interface

## Data Storage and Sharing

### Local Storage Only

All data collected by IP Gatekeeper is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage API. We do not:
- Transmit your IP address or any other data to our servers
- Share your information with any third parties
- Use cloud storage for any user data
- Maintain any databases of user information

### Session-Based Processing

IP information is processed in real-time and is not persistently stored beyond what's necessary for the current checking process.

## Third-Party Services

IP Gatekeeper uses a public IP geolocation API (api.country.is) to determine your IP's country code. This service receives your IP address when performing checks, but we do not share any identifying information with this service. We recommend reviewing their privacy policy for more information on how they process IP data.

## Your Rights and Choices

You can:
- Disable the extension at any time
- Remove the extension to completely eliminate all stored data
- Configure which websites are protected by the extension

## Children's Privacy

IP Gatekeeper is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as we update our extension. We encourage you to periodically review this policy.
